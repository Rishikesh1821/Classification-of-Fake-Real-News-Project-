# Classification of Real/Fake News(Project)

In our modern era where the internet is ubiquitous, everyone relies on various online resources for news. Along with the increase in the use of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc. news spread rapidly among millions of users within a very short span of time.
The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. With the current usage of social media platforms, consumers are creating and sharing more information than ever before, some of which are misleading with no relevance to reality. Mass media have an enormous influence on the society, and because it often happens, there's someone who wants to require advantage of this fact. Sometimes to realize some goals mass-media may manipulate the knowledge in several ways. This result in producing of the news articles that isnâ€™t completely true or maybe completely false. There even exist many websites that produce fake news almost exclusively. 
And hence, classifying a piece of news whether it's fake or real becomes all the more important.
